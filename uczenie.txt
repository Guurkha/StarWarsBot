Luke... Luke
Ben?
You will go to the Dagobah system
There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me
It's metal.
Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.
Admiral
Yes, Captain
What is it, General?
My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed.
You got your clearance to leave.
Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First I'm going to get you to your ship.
Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.
I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
I am wondering, why are you here?
I'm looking for someone.
Hey!  That's my dinner
How you get so big, eating food of this kind?
Stop that.
Stop what?
Stop that!  My hands are dirty.
My hands are dirty, too.  What are you afraid of?
I happen to like nice men.
I'm a nice man.
No, you're not.  You're...
What is thy bidding, my master?
There is a great disturbance in the Force.
I have felt it.
We have a new enemy - Luke Skywalker.
Yes, my master.
He could destroy us.
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
The Force is strong with him.
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great asset.  Can it be done?
Mostly because of my father, I guess.
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
We're wasting our time.
I cannot teach him.  The boy has no patience.
He will learn patience.
Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.
He is not ready.
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm ready.
You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...
Sit down, sweetheart.  We're taking off!
We're doomed!
The cave is collapsing.
This is no cave.
Is the dark side stronger?
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier, more seductive.
I feel cold, death.
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.
What's in there?
Great Darkness
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out now
So certain are you.  Always with you it cannot be done. 
All right, I'll give it a try
No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.  There is no try
I can't.  It's too big.
Size matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size, do you?
I don't believe it.
That is why you fail.
Where are we?
The Anoat system.
Future?  Will they die?
Difficult to see.
That boy is our last hope.
No.  There is another
You look absolutely beautiful.
Thank you.
What about Han?
Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.
Lord Vader
Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
did he survive?
Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect hibernation
There is no escape
Don't make me destroy you
If you only knew the power of the dark side.
He told me enough!
No.  I am your father.
They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments
Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive
It's Vader.
Luke... it is your destiny.
Artoo
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!
Good morning.
Bo Shuda!
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
Someone who loves you.
I can't see.
Your eyesight will return in time.
You serve your master well.
And you will be rewarded.
Han!
Luke!
How are we doing?
The same as always.
Hi
Rise, my friend.
Soon will I rest.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
is Darth Vader my father?
Your father he is, Told you, did he?
There's still good in him.
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
Hey, are you awake?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling
Do they have a code clearance?
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.
Where's Leia?
What? She didn't come back?
Chewie
give 'em your crossbow.
Luke, what's wrong?
Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Just...images, really. Feelings.
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?
Vader is here...now, on this moon.
He's my father
Your father?
The Emperor has been expecting you.
I know, father.
Come with me.
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.
lightsaber
Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your father's
trap
It's a trap!
Freeze! Don't move!
We surrender
I love you.
I know.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
I will not fight you, father.
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side.
So be it...Jedi.
I'm going in.
Here goes nothing.
I can't leave you here.
You already have, Luke. You were right about me
Yoda
Great little jedi he is
Mance Windu
Hehe, he got his arm cutted from, and went through windu
A Republic cruiser! That's trouble...don't you think?
I'm not made to think.

It's not about the mission, Master, it's somethging...elsewhere...elusive.
Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.
Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...
.....but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.
Yes, Master...how do you think the trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?
These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.

I want destroyer droids up here at once!!!
We will not survive this.

Close the blast doors!!!
...They're still coming through!
Impossible!! This is impossible!!
Where are those destroyer droids?!

Destroyer droids!
Offhand, I'd say this mission is past the negotiaion stage.

We have them on the run, sir...they're no match for destroyer droids.
Sir, they've gone up the ventilation shaft.

Battle droids.
It's an invisible army.
It's an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.
You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.

Oyi, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!
Are you brainless? You almost got us killed!
I spake.
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get outta here!

The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.
Queen Amidala is yound and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult. You have done well, Viceroy.

There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant...the hyperdrive is leaking.
We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.
Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.

This is getting out of hand...now there are two of them.
We should not have made this bargain. What will happen when the Jedi become aware of these Sith Lords?

What do you want?
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.
Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. What kinda junk?

Are you an angel?
What?
An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. 

You're...a slave?
I am a person! My name is Anakin.

I have 20,000 Republic dataries.
Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...

The Force is unusally strong with him, that much is clear. Who was his father?
There was no father, that I know of...I carried him, I gave him birth...I can't explain what happened. Can you help him?

Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!
No Jedi has.

...my only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.
A Sith Lord?!?
Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.

I request the boy be tested.
Trained as a Jedi, you request for him?
Finding him was the will of the Force...I have no doubt of that.
Bring him before us, then.
Tested he will be.

The boy will not pass the Council's tests, Master, and you know it. He is far too old.
Anakin will become A Jedi...I promise you.
Don't defy the Council, Master..not again.
I will do what I must.
Master, you could be sitting on the Council by now if you would just follow the code. They will not go along with you this time.
You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

Your thoughts dwell on your mother.
I miss her.
Afraid to lose her..I think.
What's that got to do with anything?
Eveything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering.

Obi-Wan promise...promise me you'll train the boy...
Yes, Master...
He is the chosen one...he will...bring balance...train him!

There is no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.
Always two there are....no more...no less. A maste and an apprentice.
But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

Annie?? My goodness you've grown.
So have you... grown more beautiful, I mean... and much shorter... for a Senator, I mean.

Sorry, I forgot you don't like flying, Master.
I don't mind flying... but what you're doing is suicide!

Yes, I'm trying to find a planet system called Kamino. It doesn't seem to show upon any of the archive charts.
Kamino? It's not a system I'm familiar with... Let me see...
Are you sure you have the right co-ordinates?
I hate to say it, but it looks like the system you're searching for doesn't exist.
That's impossible... perhaps the archives are incomplete.
The archives are comprehensive and totally secure, my young Jedi. One thing you may be absolutely sure of - if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!

We used to lie on the sand
I don't like sand. 

You must be anxious to inspect the units for yourself.
That's why I'm here.

Mom... Mom... Mom... 
Annie...? Is it you?
I'm here, Mom. You're safe. Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here...

I killed them. 
And not just the men, but the women and the children, too.

Annie, you have grown
That's not the only thing that grown

Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.
Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...

What was that all about?
Well, Artoo has been . . .
No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.
Did I say anything?
He's trying!
I didn't say anything!

Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.
Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.
Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.
You're the Master. I'm just a hero.
I'm open to suggestions here.
Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.

Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?
You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?
Well?
Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.

How are you feeling?
He keeps kicking.
He?! Why do you think it's a boy?
My motherly intuition.
Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.

Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.
Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.
Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?
The Senate will decide your fate.
I am the Senate!
Not yet!
It's treason, then.

Master Yoda, you survived.
Surprised?

Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from.
I see, sir.
Uh, you can call me Luke.
I see, sir Luke.
Just Luke.

you turned her against me!
you have donr that by yourself

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

That's it! We did it!
We did it!

Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?
Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.

Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.
Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.

I shouldn't . . .
Do it!!

You have grown
That is not the only thing that grown!

That's it! We did it!
We did it!

Hello, there!
General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!
Is it possible to learn this power?
not from the yedi

tell me legend
have you heard the tragedy of darth plagueis the wise
You turned her against me!
You have DONE THAT YOURSELF.
YOUR. NEW. EMPIRE?
DON'T MAKE ME KILLL YOOUU
Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... TO DEMOCRACY!
If you're not with me, you're my ENEMY.
ONLY A SITH Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.
YoU WILL TRY!
